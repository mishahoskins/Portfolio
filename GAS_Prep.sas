 * Program Name:  GAS_Prep
 * Author:        Mikhail Hoskins
 * Date Created:  05/14/2025
 * Date Modified: 10/20/2025
 * Description:   We want to evaluate GAS over the last decade + in NC. Recent study showed an increase year over year, can we replicate for NC.
 *				  (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831512#)
 *
 * Inputs:       case.sas7bdat , case_phi.sas7bdat , Admin_question_package_addl.sas7bdat : Z:\YYYYMMDD (denormalized cases, PHI (deidentified), and administrative packages.
 * Output:       GAS analysis dataset(s)
 * Notes:        Skillsets:
 *					SQL,extraction from denormalized tables, case classification logic,  multiple conditional joins, EHR extraction and joins, pattern matching, setting-specific dataset creation. (MSSQL usage optional here)
