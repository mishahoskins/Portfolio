 * Program Name:  GAS_analysis
 * Author:        Mikhail Hoskins
 * Date Created:  04/09/2025
 * Date Modified: 10/20/2025
 * Description:   We want to evaluate GAS over the last decade + in NC. Recent study showed an increase year over year, can we replicate for NC?
 *				  (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831512#)
 *
 * Inputs:      GAS analysis dataset from GAS_Prep
 * Output:       GAS_analysis_tables: case counts and rates, tests for linearity (Rsq. > 0.50 counted as "linear" for this analysis :/...), and C-A Trend Test 
 * Notes:        Skillsets:
 *					cleaning and numerical assignments of variables of interest, incidence rates x100,000 and appropriate denoms where applicable, mortality in LTCF logistic regression with backwards elmination of P < 0.2 vars (or key vars),
 *					test for linearity for each variable by year (ie. injection drug use increased year over year, is it linear?), C-A for linearity > 0.50, prep and export data for Mann-Kendall analysis in R for non-linear vars, ODS output
