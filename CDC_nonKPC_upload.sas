 * Program Name:  CDC_nonKPC_upload 
 * Author:        Mikhail Hoskins
 * Date Created:  08/25/2025
 * Date Modified: 10/20/2025
 * Description:   CPO count by mechanism data pull from monthly denormalized tables. Easy to run in office, can take longer
				  on VPN. 
 *
 * Inputs:       laboratory_dd_table_cre : Z:\YYYYMMDD (denormalized lab table)
 *				 admin_trail : Z:\YYYYMMDD (denormalized admin package)
 *
 * Output:       CDC_nonKPC_RedCap_DATE.xlsx <-- ODS output, line list of all CPO within specified date range to review and submit to CDC. 
 *
 * Notes:        Skillsets: General ETL, SQL, Macros, %like extraction, regular expression (PRX), conditional joins, deduplication
 *
