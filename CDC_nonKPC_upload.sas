 * Program Name:  CDC_nonKPC_upload 
 * Author:        Mikhail Hoskins
 * Date Created:  08/25/2025
 * Date Modified: .
 * Description:   CPO count by mechanism data pull from monthly denormalized tables. Easy to run in office, can take longer
				  on VPN. 
 *
 * Inputs:       laboratory_dd_table_cre : Z:\YYYYMMDD
 * Output:       CDC_nonKPC_RedCap_DATE.xlsx <-- a line list of all CPO within specified date range to review and submit to CDC. 
 * Notes:        Program pulls CPO HAIs. ***CPOs will be updated in the denormalized tables to 
 *				 reflect CPO rule change . 
 *				 Annotations are between /* to help guide.
